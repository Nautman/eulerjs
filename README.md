# Euler.js

A JavaScript library for visualising the wonders of mathematics.

## Introduction

Euler.js is a library built for HTML5 canvases. It is created and currently managed by me, Nautman.

Please note that Euler is still in it's early stage and is currently not very advanced. But not for long! Currently it has some (relatively!) basic things like drawing arcs, circles and lines. But it also includes some more advanced things like drawing shapes with x amount of corners!

## Usage

Download the euler.js file and make sure it is in the same repository as your html file. Add script tag inside HTML code.
``` html
<script src="euler.js"></script>
```
